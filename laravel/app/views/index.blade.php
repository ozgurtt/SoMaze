@section('content')
    Much traps. Many deaths. Such coin. So Maze. Wow.</p>
    <p>Good news everyone!  SoMaze is now in open alpha testing!  We're still a little ways away from being ready for primetime, but we want to let everyone try it out, give their feedback, and shape the future of the game.  When you sign up, you'll automatically receive 100,000 coins.  These will look like Dogecoins on the site (they'll have the little Dogecoin symbol next to them), but they will have ABSOLUTELY NO value.  You will not be able to withdraw them.  We aren't going to enable real Dogecoins until the site is ready to go live.</p>
    <p>That doesn't mean that there's no way to get Dogecoins during testing.  We'll be doing periodic database wipes, and before we do one, we'll reward the top user (or users) with Dogecoins as a way of saying "thank you for playing".</p>
    <p>We're also offering bug bounties to users who find bugs within the system.  If you find a bug on the site, email me with complete details of it, along with your Dogecoin address.  If you're the first user to report it to me, I'll send you some Dogecoins (more for more severe bugs).</p>
    <p>We have lots of cool things planned, so stay tuned, enjoy the game, and please follow me on Twitter.</p>
